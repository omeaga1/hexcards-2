# Choosing Arc components and blocks

Pick the item whose job matches, not the one that looks closest. Ids below are the install names (`npx shadcn@latest add @uiarc/<id>`). Items marked Pro need an Arc Pro token; offer the free pick otherwise.

## How to decide

1. Name the job in one line ("pick one of three plans", "confirm deleting a project").
2. Find candidates in the tables below or with `search_components`.
3. Read each candidate's markdown (`https://uiarc.dev/components/<id>/markdown` or `get_component`). "When not to use" names the better alternative; follow it.
4. Prefer a block for a whole region, a component for a single control. Replace block sample data; do not keep placeholder names or numbers.
5. Use the same item for the same job everywhere in the app: one confirmation pattern, one menu, one table.

## Marketing blocks

Free: `site-header`, `hero-section`, `logo-marquee`, `stats-band`, `plan-comparison`, `comparison-table`, `faq-section`, `cta-section`, `newsletter-signup`, `contact-section`, `blog-grid`, `changelog-feed` (copy from its docs page; not in the registry), `site-footer`.

Pro: `hero-signup`, `feature-bento`, `feature-illustration`, `scroll-story`, `spotlight-grid`, `testimonial-stage`, `team-showcase`, `pricing-calculator`, `usage-pricing`, `value-calculator`.

Notes:
- `plan-comparison` is a finished two-plan demo with its own billing switch and sample data. For your own plans, compose `billing-toggle`, `radio-cards` or your plan cards, and `plan-matrix` (see example-pricing.md).
- Blocks with props (`hero-section`, `cta-section`, `faq-section`, `stats-band`, `comparison-table`, `site-header`) take your content directly. Blocks without props (`page-header`, `plan-comparison`) are starting points: edit their data in the installed file.

## Wiring rules

- Copy the import from the usage example: `import { Button } from "@/components/arc/button/button";`, `import SegmentedControl from "@/components/arc/segmented-control/segmented-control";`, blocks from `@/components/arc/blocks/<id>/<id>`.
- Use only documented props. Extra native props pass through to the root; use `className` for layout (margin, grid placement), never to restyle internals.
- Pick controlled (`value` plus a change handler) or uncontrolled (`defaultValue`), not both.
- Async callbacks (`onConfirm`, `onSubmit`, `onSave`) return the promise; reject to show the item's error state. Do not add a second spinner.
- Wrap an Arc component to add behavior; do not fork its source.
